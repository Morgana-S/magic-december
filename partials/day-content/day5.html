      <p>Every year on 5 December, the world comes together to celebrate International Volunteer Day (IVD), a

        communities and the world a better place.</p>

      <h5>The Heart of Volunteering</h5>
      <p>Established by the United Nations in 1985, International Volunteer Day is more than just a date on the
        calendar—it's a global movement that recognises the transformative power of ordinary people doing
        extraordinary things. From helping local communities to addressing global challenges, volunteers are the
        unsung heroes who bring hope, compassion, and positive change.</p>

      <h5>Why Volunteering Matters</h5>
      <p>Volunteering isn't just about giving time; it's about creating a lasting impact:</p>

        <li>Career Development: Volunteers are 27% more likely to find employment</li>
        <li>Global Solutions: Collaborative efforts lead to more inclusive and sustainable solutions</li>
      </ul>

        connection and mutual support. This day reminds us that when we work together, we can create meaningful
        change. So, put on your volunteering spirit and make a difference—one act of kindness at a time!</p>
