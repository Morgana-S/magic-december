    International Migrants Day, observed annually on 18 December, shines a spotlight on the protection of
    migrants' human rights and celebrates their invaluable contributions to societies worldwide.<br><br>
    Since time immemorial, humans have been on the move, seeking greener pastures for food, water, and shelter.
    Sometimes, conflict forced people to leave their homelands in search of new beginnings. As borders were drawn
    and nations formed, migrants often played a pivotal role in shaping new countries. Take the United States, for
    instance, established by English migrants seeking religious freedom. Between 1900 and 1915, a whopping 15
    million migrants made their way to American shores from various corners of the globe.

  <h5>Notable Migrations Throughout History</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>1944: 700,000 people fled Chechnya for Central Asia to escape Joseph Stalin's regime.</li>
    <li>1947-1950: Over 15 million people moved between India and Pakistan due to religious conflicts.</li>
    <li>1948-1950: 2 million Chinese migrants left China for Taiwan and other countries to escape communism.</li>
    <li>1882-present: 3.6 million Jews have returned to their homeland, Israel, from all over the world.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    While migrants often leave their familiar surroundings in search of a better life, they frequently face a host
    of challenges in their new homes. These can include language barriers, poverty, employment difficulties,
    discrimination, inadequate housing, and transportation issues. Access to economic assistance and healthcare
    can
    also prove tricky.

    Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families in
