      <p>National Sock Day is celebrated every year on December 4th, and itâ€™s the perfect occasion to appreciate those
        cosy, colourful accessories that keep our feet warm and stylish. Founded in 2016 by the clothing company Pair
        of Thieves, this fun holiday encourages everyone to embrace the joy of socks while also promoting goodwill and
        charity.</p>

      <h5>A Brief History</h5>
      <p>Socks have a fascinating history that dates back over 2,000 years when early humans crafted them from matted
        goat hair to keep their feet warm. Over the centuries, socks evolved into fashionable items made from various
        materials like cotton, wool, and silk. National Sock Day was established not only to celebrate these versatile
        accessories but also to give back to those in need. Each year, Pair of Thieves donates a pair of socks for
        every social media post using the hashtag #NationalSockDay, helping to provide warmth to those less fortunate.
