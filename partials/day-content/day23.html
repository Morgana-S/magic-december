      <h5>Historical Background</h5>
      National Christmas Movie Marathon Day is a relatively new tradition that
      began in the early 2000s. It encourages people to take a break from the
      holiday rush and indulge in back-to-back viewings of their favourite
      Christmas films.<br /><br />
      The history of Christmas movies dates back to 1898 with the first
      Christmas-themed film, Santa Claus, a silent short. Over the years,
      Christmas movies have evolved, including adaptations of A Christmas Carol
      and heartwarming films like It’s a Wonderful Life. The availability of
      home video in the 1980s and later streaming services have made it easier
      for families to enjoy these films anytime, not just when they are
      broadcast on TV
      <h5>Making it Special</h5>
      This day is not just about watching movies; it's about creating new
      memories and reliving cherished moments with family and friends. It brings
      warmth and nostalgia, uniting people in a shared experience of joy and
      entertainment. So, grab your favourite Christmas movies, get comfy, and
      let the marathon begin!<br /><br />
      By celebrating National Christmas Movie Marathon Day, you're keeping the
      flame of Christmas spirit burning bright, one heartwarming scene at a
