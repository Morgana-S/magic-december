  <h5>History of Stupid Toy Day</h5>
  <p>Toys play a vital role in childhood, but let’s be honest—some are just plain silly! On this day, we look back
    fondly at the bizarre collection of toys that filled our playrooms, each boasting its own outrageous sounds
    and sticky textures. Stupid Toy Day was first observed in 2017, providing a perfect opportunity to reflect on
    the toys that made us laugh and cringe in equal measure.</p>
