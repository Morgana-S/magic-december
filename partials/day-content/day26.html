  Kwanzaa is a special holiday that celebrates African American culture,
  bringing families and communities together in unity. Over seven days, you
  reflect on principles like self-determination and creativity, fostering a deep
  connection to your roots. Imagine gathering with loved ones, lighting candles
  that symbolize hope, sharing delicious meals, and exchanging meaningful gifts.
  Kwanzaa is a heartfelt reminder of the strength found in community and the
  importance of honouring our ancestors. Join in the festivities to experience
  the joy of togetherness and celebrate life!

      Kwanzaa is a week-long celebration, more of a marathon than a one-day
      sprint. This annual holiday is observed in nations with African diaspora
      populations, celebrating their rich cultural contributions. <br />
      The roots of Kwanzaa trace back to ancient African "first fruits" harvest
      celebrations. While specifics varied across cultures, they shared core
      values like community gatherings, gratitude to Creator(s), and commitment
      to expanding African cultural thought. <br />
      The modern Kwanzaa emerged from the Black Freedom Movement in 1966 in the
      United States. Dr Maulana Karenga, a Black Studies professor, established
      it as a means to unite African Americans following the Civil Rights
      Movement. The name "Kwanzaa" comes from the Swahili phrase "matunda ya
      kwanza", meaning "first fruits".
      <br />
      Initially introduced as an alternative to Christmas, Dr Karenga later
      clarified it wasn't meant to replace religious holidays but to enhance
      celebrations. By 2004, an estimated 28 million African Americans
      celebrated Kwanzaa.
      <h5>How to Celebrate Kwanzaa</h5>
      Kwanzaa celebrations often revolve around the Nguzo Saba, or seven
      principles:
      <ul>
        Umoja (Unity) - Day 1
        <li>
          Families might host a gathering, inviting neighbours and friends to
          share a meal and stories.
        </li>
        Kujichagulia (Self-Determination) - Day 2
        <li>
          Reflect on personal goals and aspirations, perhaps jotting them down
          or sharing them with loved ones.
        </li>
        Ujima (Collective Work and Responsibility) - Day 3
        <li>Organise a community task, like cleaning a local park.</li>
        Ujamaa (Cooperative Economics) - Day 4
        <li>
          Purchase gifts or necessities from local African American-owned
          businesses.
        </li>
        Nia (Purpose) - Day 5
        <li>
          Set a collective goal for the New Year, such as volunteering in the
          community.
        </li>
        Kuumba (Creativity) - Day 6
        <li>
          Engage in arts and crafts, creating decorations representing Kwanzaa
          principles.
        </li>
        Imani (Faith) - Day 7
        <li>
          Attend a church or prayer service, or take a quiet moment to meditate
          and reaffirm faith.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Each family celebrates Kwanzaa in their own way, often including family
      gatherings, small gift exchanges, shared meals, and engagement in African
      cultural activities9. Some families strictly adhere to Kwanzaa traditions,
      while others may incorporate elements into their Christmas festivities.
