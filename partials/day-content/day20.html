        International Human Solidarity Day, observed annually on 20 December, is a powerful global celebration of
        unity,
        diversity, and collective compassion. This remarkable day encourages people worldwide to recognise our shared
        humanity and work together to address global challenges through mutual understanding and support.

      <h5>The Essence of Solidarity</h5>
      <p>Solidarity represents more than just a conceptâ€”it's a profound psychological connection that binds societies
        together through shared interests and objectives. The United Nations Millennium Declaration emphasises that
        those
        who suffer least should help those who suffer most, embodying a spirit of fairness, equity, and social
        justice.
      </p>
      <h5>How to Participate</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Reflect on Solidarity: Consider what unity means to you and your community.</li>
        <li>Support Relief Efforts: Donate to organisations combating poverty.</li>
        <li>Community Action: Find local ways to help those in need.</li>
        <li>Share Your Compassion: Connect with like-minded individuals committed to making a difference.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Historical Background</h5>
      <p>The UN established the World Solidarity Fund in 2002, with a mission to eradicate poverty and promote social
        development, particularly among the most vulnerable populations. In 2005, the UN officially proclaimed 20
        December
        as International Human Solidarity Day, recognising solidarity as a fundamental universal value for
        21st-century
        international relations.</p>
