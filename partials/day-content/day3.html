      <p>Let’s Hug Day, celebrated on December 3rd, is all about embracing the warmth and comfort that hugs bring.
        Hugs are versatile gestures of affection; they can express joy when we’re happy, provide solace when we’re
        feeling low, and serve as a perfect way to reconcile after a disagreement. Not only do hugs make us feel good
        emotionally, but they also release hormones that can help lower stress and blood pressure, making them
        beneficial for our health!</p>

      <h5>A Bit of History</h5>
      <p>While the exact origins of Let’s Hug Day are unclear, some believe it was inspired by Kevin Zaborney, who
        created National Hugging Day on January 31st. The idea behind both days is to encourage people to show
        affection and support through hugs. The word "hug" comes from the Old Norse word "hugga," which means "to
        comfort," highlighting the nurturing aspect of this simple yet profound gesture.</p>

      <h5>How to Celebrate Let’s Hug Day</h5>
      <p>Here are some fun and meaningful ways to celebrate this heartwarming day:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Give a Big Hug: Start your day by hugging a family member or friend. It’s a wonderful way to spread love
          and set a positive tone for the day!</li>
        <li>Hug a Stranger (with Permission): If you’re feeling adventurous, why not ask someone if they’d like a hug?
          Just remember to respect personal space!</li>
        <li>Learn About the Benefits of Hugs: Take some time to explore how hugging can reduce stress, improve heart
          health, and boost your immune system. Sharing this knowledge can inspire others to embrace more hugs in
          their lives.</li>
