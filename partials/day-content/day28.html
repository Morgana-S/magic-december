  National Call a Friend Day, celebrated on December 28, is a delightful
  reminder to reconnect with friends amidst the holiday hustle. As we transition
  from Christmas to the New Year, it’s the perfect time to pick up the phone and
  reach out to that friend you’ve been meaning to contact. In our fast-paced
  lives, technology can sometimes make us feel more isolated, despite being just
  a click away from each other. This special day encourages us to prioritise
  genuine conversations, as hearing a friend's voice can strengthen bonds and
  lift spirits. So why not take a few moments to call an old schoolmate, check
  in with a close friend, or even organise a group video chat? Celebrate the joy
  of friendship and make someone’s day by simply reaching out!

      <h5>History of National Call a Friend Day</h5>
      Situated just between Christmas and New Year’s, National Call a Friend Day
      is meant to be a time between these two big days to make sure that friends
      stay connected. This is especially important for friends who don’t
      necessarily live near each other.<br />
      In today’s world of technology, even though in some ways it has the
      possibility to bring people together, people can feel more isolated than
      ever. Because social media only portrays the surface, it’s important to be
      sure that actual personal contact and connections are made through
      conversation. <br />
      Considering the fact that the holiday season is a time when many people
      struggle with depression and even suicidal ideations, it’s very important
      to try to stay connected. And voice-based communication is an important
      way that helps people feel seen and heard. <br />
      National Call a Friend Day is the time to reach out to friends with a
      phone call and connect with them. Let them know they are thought of and
      cared for, and catch up with what is going on in each others’ lives.
