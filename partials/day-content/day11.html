  <h5>History of National Tango Day</h5>
  <p>National Tango Day was established to honour two iconic figures in Argentine tango: Carlos Gardel and Julio
    De Caro, who share a birthday. The idea originated from Ben Molar, a passionate composer, who proposed an
    official day to celebrate tango's significance in Argentine culture. After gaining approval from the Buenos
    Aires government in the 1970s, December 11 was designated as National Tango Day, allowing people worldwide to
    appreciate this expressive dance form.</p>

  <p>Today, National Tango Day not only celebrates the music and dance but also embraces the rich cultural history
    associated with tango, bringing people together in joy and connection.</p>
