        Bhutan National Day is a vibrant occasion that commemorates the
        coronation of the first king of Bhutan, Ugyen Wangchuck, in 1907. This significant holiday transforms the
        Changlimithang Stadium into a hub of festivities, where Bhutanese people gather to honour their rich history
        and the establishment of the monarchy that continues to shape their nation today.

      <h5>History of Bhutan National Day</h5>
      <p>
        The roots of Bhutan National Day trace back to the early 17th century when the country was unified under the
        guidance of Buddhist monk Ngawang Namgyal. However, it was Ugyen Wangchuck, the Ponlop of Tongsa, who emerged
        as a pivotal figure in the late 19th century, uniting Bhutan and establishing a monarchy after abolishing the
        previous dual system of governance. His coronation on 17 December 1907 marked the beginning of the Wangchuck
        dynasty, which still reigns today as a symbol of stability and unity for the Bhutanese people.
